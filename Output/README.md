# Example output
Download the example output and view in the `view_widgets.html` file. If you're a git user, simply clone or fork the repo. Otherwise, follow the steps below.Apologies -- this process is clunky but I am working on web hosting in the future.

Download all of the `.html` files in this output folder (click each file, right-click on view raw, download). Save all these files to the *same* folder, making sure the extension on each is `.html`.

View the output by dragging the `view_widgets.html` file into your browser.

If you are having any issues, please email me and I'll find another way to get the files to you.
