# Example output
Download the example output and view in the `view_widgets.html` file. Apologies -- this process is clunky but I am working on web hosting in the future. 

Download all of the `.html` files in this output folder (right-click, download). Save all these files to the *same* folder (make sure the extension on each is `.html`).

View the output by dragging the `view_widgets.html` file into your browser.

If you are having any issues, please email me and I'll find another way to get the files to you.
